# COVID-19 Analysis & Forecasting — India vs World

A comprehensive Machine Learning project analyzing the global and Indian COVID-19 scenario with data‑driven visualizations and predictive modelling.

## 📌 Project Scope

* Comparative analysis of India with major global epicenters
* Heatmaps, growth curves, daily change tracking
* State‑wise insights for India (testing, healthcare, demographics)
* Machine learning–based forecasting of case escalation & resource demand

## 🔍 Key Analyses

### Global Overview

* Worldwide heatmap of confirmed / recovered / deaths
* Top 5 most affected countries
* Country‑wise case percentage impact

### Epicenter Deep Dives

* China (origin)
* Italy, USA, South Korea, UK, Japan, Australia
* Timeline curves — daily confirmed, recovered, deaths
* Lockdown effectiveness study

### India Focus

* India as fastest‑growing epicenter
* Daily confirmed / recovered / death trend curves
* Impact of nationwide lockdown
* Statewise tree‑map & demographic impact (age/gender)
* Hospital beds vs confirmed cases — crisis prediction

## 🤖 Machine Learning Prediction

* Forecasting future case growth (upcoming months)
* Estimating hospital bed requirements
* When states may exhaust medical capacity
